I'd like to start out by saying this project is for educational purposes only and all respective trademarks belong to Nintendo, GameFreak and The Pokemon Company.

# Pokemon Java
It's a work in progress.

## Features
The goal of this program is to create a pure Java implementation of Gen 1 Pokemon while attempting to stay true to the entire game (that includes glitches and missingNo). 

## But Why?
### There's already emulators and gamebody cartridges and pokemon showdown, etc.
Why not? Expanding my horizons. Mostly it's for fun and to say I did it.
